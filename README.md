This app is a self-learning project that I did during my free time so I can better learn Vue.js and what the framework offers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=1226s) is the tutorial that I followed.

Some basic functions of a to-do list, or task tracker, application is displayed in this app:

### 1. Add a New Task with a Due Date

### 2. Adding an Empty Task is Not Allowed

### 3. Prioritize the Task by a Simple Click

### 4. Open and Close the 'Add Task' Form

### 5. Pop-up when Delete a Task to Confirm
