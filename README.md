# View the app [here](https://sue-nguyen.github.io/vue-task-tracker/).

This app is a self-learning project that I did during my free time so I can better learn Vue.js and what the framework offers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=1226s) is the tutorial that I followed.

# Some basic functions of a to-do list, or task tracker, application is displayed in this app:

### 1. Add a New Task with a Due Date
